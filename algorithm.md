Goal: Make a program where you can interact with a virtual pet. You will be able to feed the pet and play with the pet. When you play with the pet the hunger level will go down and when you feed the pet it will go up. You will be able to see all the pets you have and see their hunger levels. Also, be able to add a new pet or delete a pet. 

Input: The user will be able to input a new pet or delete a pet. Users will be able to feed the pet and choose what activity to play with the pet.

Output: The output will be the list of the pets and the pets status. 

Steps: There will be a need for 3 classes. It will be for the pet, user interface/menu, and the serialization. The pet will handle all the attributes of the pet(Name, type, color, gender, age, weight, height, hunger). The interface/menu will handle all the UI for the user. The serialization will save all the pets added/deleted when the program restarts.
